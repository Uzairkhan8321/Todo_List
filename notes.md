Here's a breakdown of the different components and contexts:

1. `App.js`: This is the main component that sets up the routing using React Router. It wraps the entire application with the `AuthProvider` and `TodoProvider` to make the `AuthContext` and `TodoContext` available to all components. The `ProtectedRoute` component ensures that only authenticated users can access the dashboard.

2. `LoginPage.js`: This component renders the login form and handles the login logic. It uses the `AuthContext` to access the `login` function and navigate to the dashboard upon successful login.

3. `Dashboard.js`: This component represents the main dashboard page. It displays the logged-in user's username, a logout button, the search functionality, the TodoForm component for adding new todos, and the TodoList component for displaying and managing the todo items.

4. `TodoList.js`: This component displays a list of todo items and provides functionality for marking them as completed, deleting them, and toggling their completion status.

5. `TodoForm.js`: This component renders a form for adding new todo items. It uses the `addTodo` function from the `TodoContext` to create a new todo item.

6. `SearchTodo.js`: This component provides a search input field for filtering the todo items by their title.

7. `AuthContext.js`: This file creates a context for managing the authentication state. It provides the `login` and `logout` functions, as well as the `user` state.

8. `TodoContext.js`: This file creates a context for managing the todo items. It provides the `todos` state and functions for adding, deleting, and toggling the completion status of todo items.

In this solution, the `AuthContext` and `TodoContext` are used to manage the authentication state and todo items, respectively. The todo items are stored in the `TodoContext` and are passed down to the relevant components as needed.

The `Dashboard` component is the main hub where the todo functionality is implemented. It displays the logged-in user's username, a logout button, and the components for managing todo items (TodoForm, TodoList, and SearchTodo).

The `TodoList` component renders the list of todo items and provides functionality for marking them as completed, deleting them, and toggling their completion status. The `TodoForm` component allows users to add new todo items, and the `SearchTodo` component provides a search input field for filtering the todo items by their title.

Please note that this is a basic implementation, and you may need to add additional features, styling, and error handling based on your specific requirements.
